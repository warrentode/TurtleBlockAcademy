I feel like my art skills in creating original work is poor, but for some reason I seem to be able to
    edit existing images fairly well, so I work with the skills I've got and try to watch the copyrights
    closely and even if it's not required I like to give credit when I remember

So if I have forgotten you or someone you know, I swear it's not intentional, just drop me a line and
    I will add it to the list here - I will do the same for any type of credit that needs to be given
    just so you know, it doesn't have to be art related
